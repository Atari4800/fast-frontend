## Team-Fast-Frontend This project's goal is to create a framework that has been designed to efficiently route delivery drivers coming from a single location. It also provides an easy-to-use interface (on the frontend) for managers that create routes, as well as the drivers that deliver using those routes.

## Milestone 1 Release Notes: All of our frontend pages are still in development. Currently, we have the file structure setup for our pages. In addition, we have a working example component in our "example" folder which we will use as reference in subsequent milestones.

Our original goal for milestone 1 was to complete the Data component page. That goal turned out to be impractical as our frontend team scrambled to implement a tool (REACT) that they had just learned. To stay productive, our frontend team decided to implement an example component which is working locally. Our team will reference that example as we create our Data component. We plan to have our Data component complete by 10/10.
