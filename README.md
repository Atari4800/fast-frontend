## Team-2Fast2Furious-Frontend

As noted by Team-Fast's README file, this project seeks to implement a route generation service for the Intercultural Senior Center to help them create routes for their delivery drivers. Our team, Team 2Fast2Furious, aims to build on on the work of the Team-Fast. To run this application, view README in the "frontend" folder.

## Milestone 1 Release Notes:

Due to the scope and complexity of the codebase, our first milestone objective was to simply set up the local environment. After several weeks, we have been able to successfully set up the application on all team members' machines.

The second milestone objective was to familiarize ourselves with the codebase and APIs that have been implemented. This has been a challenge as many of the tools such as PostgreSQL and REACT were unfamiliar to the group beforehand. Thus this is likely going to be an ongoing process as the group learns more about the development resources.

The third milestone objective was to fix any visible bugs that occurred within the application. This is currently a work in progress, but we are pleased to report that at least one particularly visible bug has been fixed (an output error that showed the term "undefined" in a display field). Further improvements to the display are still in development.

One of our overall objectives for the project throughout the semester is to implement a map feature for routes. As of this milestone, we have successfully implemented a static map feature which provides a visualization of a generated route. We will continue to evaluate to see whether or not this feature can be improved upon.
